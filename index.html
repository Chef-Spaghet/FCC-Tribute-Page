                <h3>A small list of Zapp's military accomplishments</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Defeated the ominous Killbots by sending wave after wave of his own men at them until the Killbots reached their pre-programmed kill limit and shut down.</li>
                    <li>During the Omicronian invasion, he ordered his forces to "line up and fly directly at the enemy death cannons, clogging them with wreckage", and amid heavy losses, his forces succeed in destroying what turned out to be the Hubble Space Telescope.</li>
                    <li>He masterfully negotiated the surrender of the leaders of Spheron I after installing a powerful bomb in the chest cavity of a brave soldier.</li>
                    <li>After his victorious conquest of the "weak and womanlike" Spiderians of Tarantulon 6, the resulting plunder was split up between Earth's inhabitants, $300 for each person.</li>
